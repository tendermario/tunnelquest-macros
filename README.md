# Tunnelquest Macros

This is a hack-free system for EverQuest inventory management, designed for people that sell in the tunnel in EC.

Since the Bazaar exists in most version of EverQuest, this is primarily useful in Project1999 Blue/Green servers.

## How it works

This uses data out of raw eq inventory files and turns it into hotkey macros with purple links.

"Purple links" (in-message links to the item with details) are usually only able to be generated by ctrl + clicking on the image of an item. This only puts the item into the text field, and is not usually accessible to macros. There is [prior art][] to wedging a purple link into a macro, which involves editing your macros file.

This system currently requires pasting the output lines into your macros file.

## Instructions

1. Run in EverQuest `/exportfile inventory` on each character you want to export the inventory on. It's simplest to keep the whole inventory of a mule as sellable inventory.
2. Run Tunnelquest Macros.
3. Select the inventory files.
4. Select which items to skip (like backpacks)
5. Enter prices.
6. Copy the output list into your macros file.

## Reference Conversion

Input file(s) contents:

    Input: Tomnook-inventory.txt
    Slot Name  ID  Quantity
    Bag1 Gloves  0234  1
    Bag1-slot2 A cool sword  11113 1
    Bag1-slot2 Another sword  11114 1
    Bag1-slot2 A sword  11333 1
    Bag1-slot2 Gloves  1222 1
    ...

Output text to be pasted in your macros file:

    Page2Button5Line1=/auc WTS 002fe3000000000000000000000000000000000000000A cool sword | 002fe3000000000000000000000000000000000000000Another sword | 002fe3000000000000000000000000000000000000000A sword
